# What is a Medallion Architecture
[A Medallion architecture is a data design pattern](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture) used to logically organize data in a lakehouse, with the goal of incrementally and progressively improving the structure and quality of data as it flows through each layer of the architecture. The layers are typically referred to as Bronze, Silver, and Gold. <br/>
